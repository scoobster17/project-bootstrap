# Project Bootstrap

I'm finding newer and better ways to do things all the time, and I'm
particularly interested in things like automation at the moment whereby workflow
and productivity can be improved.

This repository has been created to store my latest configurations for all
different project setups whether it be AngularJS, React, or plain JS with a hint
of Sass.

Please note, different setups are on **different branches**.
